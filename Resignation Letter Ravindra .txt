Hello Rituraj,

It is with sincere regret that I am informing you about my decision to resign as of 10-Nov-2022. 
It has been a pleasure working at ITC Infotech and I have grown both as a person and a professional during my employment here.

However, I believe that now is the right time for me to pursue other opportunities elsewhere. 
Thank you for your understanding and I would be happy to help with the transition in any way possible.

Kind regards,
Ravindra
